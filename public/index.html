				<p><strong>Don't outsource your product's foundation.</strong> I bet you have thirty messages in your LinkedIn from different software development firms based in places like Ukraine and India. They say that they can do all kinds of development at a huge
					discount. I bet you've also heard horror stories of companies that have used similar firms -- butchered product launches, increasing delays for small fixes and feature requests, and tons of copy-paste spaghetti code. Devshops have no reason to deliver
					quality. If you pay project rate, they want to finish as quickly and cheaply as possible, and if you pay hourly they want that project to last forever.</p>

				<h2>your own talent pipeline</h2>

			<div class="content">
				<p><strong>Don't outsource your talent pipeline.</strong> First, there's no reason to pay gigantic recruiter fees. Yes it's hard to hire locally. Yes, it's hard to find talented engineers. Of course recruiters are happy to help you out. You're going
					to pay for it though. Want four developers? That's $100k in fees on top of their salaries. Of course, that's not even the worst part. Think that recruiter won't keep talking to that engineer you just hired? Think that engineer won't be recruited
					away after a year? Are you really getting your money's worth?</p>

					<strong>There's a better way.</strong> We'll work with you to build out your <strong>own</strong> engineering organization. Unlike a dev shop employees, these engineers will work for you <i>and only you</i>. You won't be just another client. <i>Your</i>					engineering culture will be <i>their</i> engineering culture.
				</p>

				<p>
					<strong>No more recruiter musical chairs.</strong> We'll work with you develop your <strong>own</strong> hiring pipeline. Scale up at will by consistently onboarding talented developers who can <i>meaningfully</i> contribute to your product.
