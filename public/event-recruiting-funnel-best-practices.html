				<h2>What Recruiting Funnel?</h2>
			</header>
			<div class="content">
				<p><strong>If you are sponsoring a tech event because you want to hire, you need a recruiting funnel.</strong> You are not going to hire anyone directly at the event (or at least I hope not). Therefore, your goal is to collect contact info so that you, your hiring managers, or your recruiters can follow up later. This is the top of the funnel. You can filter candidates with phone calls, interviews, and the ultimate hiring decision later.</p>

				<p>When sponsoring an event, your success is measured by how many qualified engineers signal interest by giving you their contact information. Like any funnel, there are things that you can do that will either help or hurt your ability to get people through to the other side.</p>

				<p>These 11 best-practices come from running over 150 technology events.</p>

				<h2>The Pitch</h2>
			</header>
			<div class="content">
				<p><strong>Your ability to attract engineers will depend on your pitch.</strong> Most events will allow the sponsor to address the audience to introduce their company. When you are on stage, use this time wisely to engage the crowd and to get qualified engineers to give you their contact information.
				</p>

				<p>Your pitch should tell engineers a little bit about your company, and a lot about why it's in their interest to leave their current job and join your company (and not another company that is trying to recruit them). When done correctly, a number of devs in the audience will be enticed to at least see where things go and start the process of trying to be hired by you.</p>
