# Meet David Guttman

David started Superstruct to build a repeatable system for finding, recruiting, vetting, onboarding, and managing talented software engineers. This system integrates over 10 years of software engineering management experience with deep technical knowledge to help companies clear milestones faster, cheaper, and with less risk.

David has led teams of engineers to ship projects like ultra-high-scale ad servers handling over 10 billion requests per day, online learning systems, white-label performance marketing SAAS platforms, and Project Matterhorn, the system that would eventually become Disney.com.

He is the author of two popular JavaScript books: Fullstack React and Fullstack Node.js and many widely-used open-source projects. He has over 90 open-source packages on npm and over 130 repositories on Github. David has given talks at many tech events and conferences like JSConf and JSFest.

David is a leader in the tech community and runs one of the largest JavaScript events in the country: js.la. This event draws world-famous speakers such as Ryan Dahl and Kyle Matthews and rising stars from the LA tech community, and regularly has standing-room only for its hundreds of attendees -- filling up large venues such as Google's main stage in Venice. Additionally, he runs the official Node.js Mentorship Team and the Los Angeles chapter of NodeSchool.

# What People Are Saying

"At the board meeting I went over the progress on the engineering side. We closed hundreds of bugs and tickets — literally hundreds. They were blown away." - Aaron Rasmussen, Founder and CEO of Outlier

“David’s help was a game changer for me. I spent months floundering to find a developer for my team. (I had, I realize now, a sub-par, ad-hoc hiring “strategy”.) But after I started working with David, I had hired a developer within the first week - and even better, I had a tested, reusable strategy for hiring quality engineers. Thanks, David!” — Nate Murray, Founder Newline.co

### LinkedIn

CTO at Interlincx, author of Fullstack React, and head organizer of js.la. Building smart software and leveraging data to optimize ad revenue with automated decision-making and traffic routing. Writing and speaking about data visualization, authentication, creative coding, and novel web experiences. Creating generative art for Yo-Yo Ma. Managing technical teams, both local and remote.

### Artist / Community

David is a community organizer, artist, author, and consultant. He runs Spec.LA, an invite-only salon for artists, inventors, makers, and other curious minds, as well as js.la, one of the largest and longest running meetups bringing some of the best known JavaScript authors and experts to give talks to the community each month. As an artist he's collaborated with world-class creatives such as Yo-Yo Ma and Bruce Adolph, and has his art showcased at museums such as LACMA and the A+D Museum. He's written two books on programming Fullstack Node.js and Fullstack React, and recently he joined Outlier as their head of engineering to help end student debt.

### Back-end

At Interlincx, David built high-performance ad servers and real-time analytics engines -- handling over 100K requests/second. He's an author, speaker, creator of widely used open-source software projects, and he has led teams at Disney and AT&T. He also organizes JS.LA, one of the largest monthly tech events in LA (~100 engineers/month).

### Proposal

There are all sorts of recruiters and companies that could potentially help you scale. So why work with me? Here are several reasons that I hope you will find compelling:

I’ve written two books on JavaScript development: Fullstack React and Fullstack Node.js which cover the two key technologies that we’ll be evaluating developers for.

I run js.la and over the last 8 years have had a unique vantage point to see the JavaScript job market from all sides.

I have personally built production apps with React and Node.js and know the skills required -- these include a video ad serving platform with real-time reporting handling over 10 Billion requests per day, a next-gen performance native ad serving SAAS, and a offer-integrated CMS for building monetized content sites.

I’ve helped a number of companies successfully replace their costly, underperforming software teams with high quality remote teams that ship.
One of my long term clients is in your industry (Interlincx), so I’ve spent years immersed in it in a “behind-the-scenes” capacity. Not only do I have domain expertise in your area, but I personally find the industry to be a lot of fun.
